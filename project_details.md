# Project Details

## Goal
Given an 8 hours strategize and complete three levels of game.

## Pre-planning
We decided on making a basic puzzle action game where the player must solve
a basic puzzle while fighting fireball breathing dragons.

We worked on proof of concepts for sprites, menu screens, and collision
detection.

We tried pygame and pyglet and went decided on pyglet as there seemed to be
more built in tools.

We are using assets from an asset pack we got on humble bundle

We spent multiple late nights planning game play mechanics and story. We
eventually settled on making a fairly basic puzzle/action game for this, our first
hackathon.

## Working Agreements
1. 8 hour session to code as much of the game as possible
2. Due to the time constraints and varied skill levels of git, pull requests
   will not be required and Jake will handle merges to master, conflicts and
   updating other developer branches
3. Use Trello for tracking tasks

## Long Term Goal
Have multiple "Game Jams"/Hackathons to complete planned vision for game
